# Messageman

The lightweight API that handle distributed job/worker & pub/sub logic. Everything is a simple HTTP/gRPC request. You can use it as a sidecar or a gateway. Distributed messages handled by built in RabbitMQ implementation.

**Important:** The software is not well tested yet. Consider making your own tests before using it in production.

## Highlights

* Language agnostic way to implement distributed messaging. Best fit for microservices.
* Everything is a simple HTTP/gRPC request.
* Lightweight. Written with golang. It doesn't serialize/deserialize the message when proxying. It only passes the body as a byte array by using fasthttp module.
* `Sidecar` and `gateway` modes.
* Super easy configuration.
* Connection and channel management.
* Failure management. (Retry logic.)
* Recover functionality. Do not worry about connection/channel loses.
* Built in `prometheus exporter` and `grafana dashboard`.
* Ready to use `helm` chart for gateway mode.
* Simple example for sidecar mode on k8s.
* Fully compatible with containerized environments such as Kubernetes.
* Supports `gRPC` both one-way and two-way.

Check the docker-compose [examples](examples/README.md) to run the complete environment(2 api to send and receive messages, messageman, rabbitmq server, prometheus and grafana).

## Usage

```bash
docker run --rm --name messageman -p 8015:8015 turgayozgur/messageman
```

Thats it! The messageman is up and ready to running with default configurations. For now, no any service registered, even so we can still send messages to queues.

### Send messages

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8015/v1/queue?name=greeting" -d '{"say":"hi!"}'
```

Make sure you have a rabbitmq server available at this url: `amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/`
```bash
docker run --rm --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 rabbitmq:3.8
```

*Note:* For gateway mode, specifying the service name on the header named `x-service-name` is recommended. Otherwise, all queue requests will use the default connection.

Everyone can call the `queue` endpoint with a queue name. What if we need to receive messages when the message arrived to the queue? At this point, just provide a messageman config that contain details about the receiver service endpoints.

### Receive messages

messageman.yml
```yaml
queues:
  - name: greeting
    worker:
      name: workerapi
      url: http://localhost:81/api/email/send
```

Run messageman with this config file. Also you can specify the config file location with using `-c` or `--config-file` arguments.

```bash
docker run --rm --name messageman -p 8015:8015 --volume=/path/to/messageman.yml:/app/messageman.yml turgayozgur/messageman
```

If the message queued to the `greeting` queue, messagemen will post the body `{"say":"hi!"}` to url `http://localhost:81/api/welcome`

## Complete example of messageman.yml

```yaml
mode: gateway # sidecar, gateway
metric: 
  enabled: true # available at /metrics path.
  exporter: prometheus
rabbitmq:
  url: amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/
events:
  - name: order_created
    subscribers:
      - name: subscriberapi
        url: localhost:83
        type: gRPC # gRPC, REST. default: REST
queues:
  - name: send_email
    worker:
      name: workerapi
      url: http://workerapi:81/api/email/send
      readiness:
        path: /readiness
      type: REST
```

*Note:* Only one service allowed for `sidecar` mode. Workers are not required.

## Gateway mode on k8s

Before applying the helm template, create your own `values.yaml` file from the default one. `./.helm/values.yaml`

```bash
helm upgrade --install messageman --values values.yaml ./.helm
```

Thats it!. You can access the messageman with this endpoint `messageman.yournamespace.svc.cluster.local`

## Sidecar mode on k8s

Apply a configmap special for the service you want to deploy.

messageman.yourservicename.configmap.yml
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: messageman-yourservicename
data:
  messageman.yml: |
    mode: sidecar
    rabbitmq:
      url: amqp://guest:guest@rabbitmqhostname:5672/
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f messageman.yourservicename.configmap.yml
```

Add the messageman container to containers of your k8s deployment configuration.

yourservicename.deployment.yml
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
...
... # other lines
...
spec:
  ...

          items:
            - key: messageman.yml
              path: messageman.yml
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f yourservicename.deployment.yml
```
