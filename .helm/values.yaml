# The services that connected to the messageman. 
# For gateway mode, every request to messageman's queue endpoint is accepted. so you don't need to provide the service details,
# but it is not recommended because this way, every queue request uses the same connection.
#
# The /readiness path for the service is required for only 'sidecar' mode.
